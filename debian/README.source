git-buildpackage
================

Upstream tarball sometimes contains *.orig files that are left over by
upstream patches. Since dh_clean will remove them, to prevent git-buildpackage
from complaining, import tarball with :

	git-import-orig --filter=*.orig --filter-pristine-tar ../node-v0.2.6.tar.gz
